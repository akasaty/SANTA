<narrator>
The hills across the valley of the Ebro were long and white. On this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun. Close against the side of the stationthere was the warm shadow of the building and a curtain, made of strings of bamboo beads, hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies. The American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside the building. It was very hot and the express from Barcelona would come in forty minutes. It stopped at thisjunction for two minutes and went to Madrid.

‘What should we drink?’ +the girl+ asked. <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP> She had taken off her hat and put it on the table.
‘It’s pretty hot,’ +the man+ said. <Man--Girl><DESC--IMP>
‘Let’s drink beer.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘Dos cervezas,’ +the man+ said into the curtain. <Man--Woman><DESC--IMP>
‘Big ones?’ +a woman+ asked from the doorway. <Woman--Man><DESC--IMP>
‘Yes. Two big ones.’ <Man--Woman><IMP--IMP>
<\characters>
<narrator>
The woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads. She put the felt pads and the beer glass on the table and looked at the man and the girl. The girl was looking off at the line of hills. They were white in the sun and the country was brown and dry.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘They look like white elephants,’ +she+ said. <Girl--Man><PRON--IMP>
‘I’ve never seen one,’ +the man+ drank his beer. <Man--Girl><DESC--IMP>
‘No, _you_ wouldn’t have.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘I might have,’ +the man+ said. ‘Just because _you_ say I wouldn’t have doesn’t prove anything.’ <Man--Girl><DESC--PRON>
<\characters>
<narrator>
The girl looked at the bead curtain.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘They’ve painted something on it,’ +she+ said. ‘What does it say?’ <Girl--Man><PRON--IMP>
‘Anis del Toro. It’s a drink.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘Could we try it?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
<\characters>

The man called ‘Listen’ through the curtain. The woman came out from the bar.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘Four reales.’ ‘We want two Anis del Toro.’ <Man--Woman><IMP--IMP>
‘With water?’ <Woman--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘Do _you_ want it with water?’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘I don’t know,’ +the girl+ said. ‘Is it good with water?’ <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>
‘It’s all right.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘_You_ want them with water?’ asked +the woman+. <Woman--Man><DESC--PRON>
‘Yes, with water.’ <Man--Woman><IMP--IMP>
‘It tastes like liquorice,’ +the girl+ said and put the glass down. <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>
‘That’s the way with everything.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘Yes,’ said +the girl+. ‘Everything tastes of liquorice. Especially all the things _you_’ve waited so long for, like absinthe.’ <Girl--Man><DESC--PRON>
‘Oh, cut it out.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘_You_ started it,’ +the girl+ said. ‘I was being amused. I was having a fine time.’ <Girl--Man><DESC--PRON>
‘Well, let’s try and have a fine time.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘All right. I was trying. I said the mountains looked like white elephants. Wasn’t that bright?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘That was bright.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘I wanted to try this new drink. That’s all we do, isn’t it = look at things and try new drinks?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘I guess so.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
<\characters>
<narrator>
The girl looked across at the hills.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘They’re lovely hills,’ +she+ said. ‘They don’t really look like white elephants. I just meant the colouring of their skin through the trees.’ <Girl--Man><PRON--IMP>

‘Should we have another drink?’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘All right.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
The warm wind blew the bead curtain against the table.
‘The beer’s nice and cool,’ +the man+ said. <Man--Girl><DESC--IMP>
‘It’s lovely,’ +the girl+ said. <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>
‘It’s really an awfully simple operation, Jig,’ +the man+ said. ‘It’s not really an operation at all.’ <Man--Girl><DESC--IMP>
The girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on.
‘I know _you_ wouldn’t mind it, Jig. It’s really not anything. It’s just to let the air in.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
<\characters>
<narrator>
The girl did not say anything.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘I’ll go with _you_ and I’ll stay with _you_ all the time. They just let the air in and then it’s all perfectly natural.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘Then what will we do afterwards?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘We’ll be fine afterwards. Just like we were before.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘What makes _you_ think so?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘That’s the only thing that bothers us. It’s the only thing that’s made us unhappy.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
<\characters>
<narrator>
The girl looked at the bead curtain, put her hand out and took hold of two of the strings of beads.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘And _you_ think then we’ll be all right and be happy.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘I know we will. _You_ don’t have to be afraid. I’ve known lots of people that have done it.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘So have I,’ said +the girl+. ‘And afterwards they were all so happy.’ <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>
‘Well,’ +the man+ said, ‘if _you_ don’t want to _you_ don’t have to. I wouldn’t have _you_ do it if _you_ didn’t want to. But I know it’s perfectly simple.’ <Man--Girl><DESC--PRON>
‘And _you_ really want to?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘I think it’s the best thing to do. But I don’t want _you_ to do it if _you_ don’t really want to.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘And if I do it _you_’ll be happy and things will be like they were and _you_’ll love me?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘I love _you_ now. _You_ know I love _you_.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘I know. But if I do it, then it will be nice again if I say things are like white elephants, and _you_’ll like it?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘I’ll love it. I love it now but I just can’t think about it. _You_ know how I get when I worry.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘If I do it _you_ won’t ever worry?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘I won’t worry about that because it’s perfectly simple.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘Then I’ll do it. Because I don’t care about me.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘What do _you_ mean?’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘I don’t care about me.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘Well, I care about _you_.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘Oh, yes. But I don’t care about me. And I’ll do it and then everything will be fine.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘I don’t want _you_ to do it if _you_ feel that way.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
<\characters>
<narrator>
The girl stood up and walked to the end of the station. Across, on the other side, were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the Ebro. Far away, beyond the river, were mountains. The shadow of a cloud moved across the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘And we could have all this,’ +she+ said. ‘And we could have everything and every day we make it more impossible.’ <Girl--Man><PRON--IMP>
‘What did _you_ say?’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘I said we could have everything.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘We can have everything.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘No, we can’t.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘We can have the whole world.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘No, we can’t.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘We can go everywhere.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘No, we can’t. It isn’t ours any more.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘It’s ours.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘No, it isn’t. And once they take it away, _you_ never get it back.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘But they haven’t taken it away.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
‘We’ll wait and see.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--IMP>
‘Come on back in the shade,’ +he+ said. ‘_You_ mustn’t feel that way.’ <Man--Girl><PRON--PRON>
‘I don’t feel any way,’ +the girl+ said. ‘I just know things.’ <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>
‘I don’t want _you_ to do anything that _you_ don’t want to do =’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘Nor that isn’t good for me,’ +she+ said. ‘I know. Could we have another beer?’ <Girl--Man><PRON--IMP>
‘All right. But _you_’ve got to realize = ‘ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘I realize,’ +the girl+ said. ‘Can’t we maybe stop talking?’ <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>
<\characters>

They sat down at the table and the girl looked across at the hills on the dry side of the valley and the man looked at her and at the table.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘_You_’ve got to realize,’ +he+ said, ‘ that I don’t want _you_ to do it if _you_ don’t want to. I’m perfectly willing to go through with it if it means anything to _you_.’ <Man--Girl><PRON--PRON>
‘Doesn’t it mean anything to _you_? We could get along.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘Of course it does. But I don’t want anybody but _you_. I don’t want anyone else. And I know it’s
perfectly simple.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘Yes, _you_ know it’s perfectly simple.’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘It’s all right for _you_ to say that, but I do know it.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘Would _you_ do something for me now?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
‘I’d do anything for _you_.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--PRON>
‘Would _you_ please please please please please please please stop talking?’ <Girl--Man><IMP--PRON>
He did not say anything but looked at the bags against the wall of the station. There were labels on them from all the hotels where they had spent nights.
‘But I don’t want _you_ to,’ +he+ said, ‘I don’t care anything about it.’ <Man--Girl><PRON--PRON>
‘I’ll scream,’ +the girl+ said. <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>

The woman came out through the curtains with two glasses of beer and put them down on the damp felt pads.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘The train comes in five minutes,’ +she+ said. <Woman--FLERA><DESC--IMP>
‘What did she say?’ asked +the girl+. <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>
‘That the train is coming in five minutes.’ <Man--Girl><IMP--IMP>
The girl smiled brightly at the woman, to thank her.
‘I’d better take the bags over to the other side of the station,’ +the man+ said. <Man--Girl><DESC--IMP> She smiled at him.
‘All right. Then come back and we’ll finish the beer.’ <Girl--Man><DESC--IMP>
<\characters>

He picked up the two heavy bags and carried them around the station to the other tracks. He looked up the tracks but could not see the train. Coming back, he walked through the bar-room, where people waiting for the train were drinking. He drank an Anis at the bar and looked at the people. They were all waiting reasonably for the train. He went out through the bead curtain. She was sitting at the table and smiled at him.
<\narrator>
<characters>
‘Do _you_ feel better?’ +he+ asked. <Man--Girl><PRON--PRON>
‘I feel fine,’ +she+ said. ‘There’s nothing wrong with me. I feel fine.’ <Girl--Man><PRON--IMP>
