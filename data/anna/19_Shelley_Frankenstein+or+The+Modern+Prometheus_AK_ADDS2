St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--

TO Mrs. Saville, England
<\narrator>
<characters>
_You_ will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which _you_ have regarded with such evil
forebodings.  I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
_my dear sister_ of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
of my undertaking. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--PRON_DESC>

I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
braces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do _you_ understand this
feeling? <Walton--Margaret><IMP--PRON> This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
and vivid.  I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
region of beauty and delight.  There, _Margaret_, the sun is forever
visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
perpetual splendour. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--EXP>

[…]

I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and
when shall I return?  Ah, _dear sister_, how can I answer this question? <Walton--Margaret><IMP--DESC>
If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before _you_
and I may meet.  If I fail, _you_ will see me again soon, or never.
Farewell, _my dear_, excellent _Margaret_. Heaven shower down blessings on
_you_, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for
all _your_ love and kindness. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--DESC_PRON>

Your affectionate brother,
  R. Walton

_My dear Sister_,

I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe==and well advanced
on my voyage. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--DESC>  

[…]

No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
letter.  One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and
I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

[…]

My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.  But I must
finish.  Heaven bless _my beloved sister_! <Walton--Margaret><IMP--DESC>

So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear
recording it, although it is very probable that _you_ will see me before
these papers can come into your possession. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--PRON>

Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
she floated.  Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
were compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to,
hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

[…]

In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and
found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
talking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
some undiscovered island, but a European. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

When I appeared on deck +the
master+ said, "Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
on the open sea." <Master--Traveller><DESC--IMP><Comment: imbedded dialogue>

On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a
foreign accent.  "Before I come on board _your_ vessel," said +he+, "will
you have the kindness to inform me whither _you_ are bound?" <Traveller--Walton><PRON--PRON>

[…]
I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
northern pole. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
Good God!  _Margaret_, if _you_ had seen the man who thus capitulated for
his safety, _your_ surprise would have been boundless. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--EXP_PRON>  His limbs were
nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
suffering.  I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.  We attempted
to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
air he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and
restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to
swallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life we
wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
kitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,
which restored him wonderfully. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>
 
[…]

When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off
the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not
allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
in so strange a vehicle. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
+he+ replied, "To seek one who fled from me." <Traveller--Lieutenant><PRON--IMP><Comment: imbedded dialogue>

"And did the man whom _you_ pursued travel in the same fashion?" <Lieutenant--Traveller><IMP--PRON>

"Yes." <Traveller--Lieutenant><IMP--IMP>

"Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked _you_ up we
saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice." <Lieutenant--Traveller><IMP--PRON>

This aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of
questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had
pursued. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

Soon after, when he was alone with me, +he+ said, "I have,
doubtless, excited _your_ curiosity, as well as that of these good
people; but _you_ are too considerate to make inquiries." <Traveller--Walton><PRON--PRON>

"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
trouble _you_ with any inquisitiveness of mine." <Walton--Traveller><PRON--PRON>

"And yet _you_ rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; _you_ have
benevolently restored me to life." <Traveller--Walton><IMP--PRON>


Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the
ice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer
with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near
midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
before that time; but of this I could not judge.  From this time a new
spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.  He
manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the
sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in
the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the
atmosphere.  I have promised that someone should watch for him and give
him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
present day.  The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all
interested in him, although they have had very little communication
with him.  For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his
constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.  He must
have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
so attractive and amiable.  +I+ said in one of my letters, my dear
_Margaret_, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have
found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should
have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart. <Walton--Margaret><PRON--EXP_PRON>

I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
should I have any fresh incidents to record. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

Yesterday +the stranger+ said to _me_, "You may easily perceive, _Captain
Walton_, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.  I had
determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
me, but _you_ have won me to alter my determination.  _You_ seek for
knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the
gratification of _your_ wishes may not be a serpent to sting _you_, as mine
has been.  I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be
useful to _you_; yet, when I reflect that _you_ are pursuing the same
course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
what I am, I imagine that _you_ may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
that may direct _you_ if _you_ succeed in _your_ undertaking and console _you_
in case of failure.  Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually
deemed marvellous.  Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might
fear to encounter _your_ unbelief, perhaps _your_ ridicule; but many things
will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would
provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed." <Traveller--Walton><DESC--PRON_DESC>

[…]

He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when
I should be at leisure.  This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.
I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my
duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has
related during the day.  If I should be engaged, I will at least make
notes.  This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest
pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own
lips--with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future
day!  Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in
my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy
sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the
lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it--thus!  <Walton--Margaret><IMP--IMP>

Chapter 1

I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most
distinguished of that republic.  My ancestors had been for many years
counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
situations with honour and reputation.  He was respected by all who
knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
business.  He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
husband and the father of a family.

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
refrain from relating them.  One of his most intimate friends was a
merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
mischances, into poverty.  This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a
proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
distinguished for his rank and magnificence.  Having paid his debts,
therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
wretchedness.  My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and
was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
so little worthy of the affection that united them.  He lost no time in
endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
the world again through his credit and assistance.

Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
months before my father discovered his abode.  Overjoyed at this
discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street
near the Reuss.  But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed
him.  Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of
his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for
some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable
employment in a merchant's house.  The interval was, consequently, spent
in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had
leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind
that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable
of any exertion.
